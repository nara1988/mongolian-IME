Letters have different forms depending on their position in a word: initial, medial, or final. In some cases, additional graphic variants are selected for visual harmony with the subsequent character.

Note that in some browsers, letters are rotated 90° counterclockwise. If the letter for 'a' looks like a 'W' and not a 'Σ', rotate the letters 90° clockwise.
